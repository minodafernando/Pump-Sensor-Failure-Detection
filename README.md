# Pump-Sensor-Failure-Detection
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a pump is operating normally or is likely to fail, based on sensor data.

## Dataset
Binary classification: Normal vs. Broken

Significant class imbalance addressed using SMOTE

## Model
Random Forest Classifier

Evaluated using confusion matrix and ROC-AUC

Final AUC score: 0.XX (replace with your result)

## Workflow
Data preprocessing and scaling

Class imbalance correction with SMOTE

Model training and evaluation

Visualization of confusion matrix and ROC curve
